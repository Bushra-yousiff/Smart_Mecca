# Abstract

  Recently, caption generation has raised a huge interest in images and videos. However, it is challenging for the models to select proper subjects in a complex
      
  background and generate desired captions in high-level vision tasks. In Artificial Intelligence (AI), the contents of an image are generated automatically which
      
  involves computer vision and NLP (Natural Language Processing).
      
  The goal of this project is to create a smart chatbot that helps pilgrims to make their journey as easy and smooth as possible by preforming two main tasks:
     
  Answering common questions, they might come across during Hajj and Umrah. Describing images to text within the area of Holy Almasjid alharam, so people who
     
  cannot see will be able to know what inside image. In addition, we improved a program that convert caption text into voice.
     
  The biggest challenge is most definitely being able to create a description that must capture not only the objects contained in an image, but also express how
    
  these objects relate to each other.

# Data Description:
   In this project we created our dataset for both "chatbot" and "image caption". Merging our dataset for Mecca images and (description) captions for each photo.  
      With  "Flickr30k" datasets.Flickr30k contains 158,915 rows and 3 columns. The total number of unique images for 
      Flickr30k are 31,783 each paired with five different captions.
